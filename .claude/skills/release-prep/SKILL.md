Prepare an orion-sdr-view release for version $ARGUMENTS.

The previous version is the one currently in `Cargo.toml`. Determine it by
reading that file. Call it OLD_VERSION. The new version is $ARGUMENTS;
call it NEW_VERSION.

## Step 1 — Verify preconditions

- Confirm the working tree is clean (`git status`). If there are uncommitted
  changes, stop and tell the user.
- Confirm NEW_VERSION > OLD_VERSION (simple string check is fine).

## Step 2 — Bump version strings

Update OLD_VERSION → NEW_VERSION in every file listed below. Read each file
before editing it.

| File | What to change |
|------|----------------|
| `Cargo.toml` | `version = "OLD_VERSION"` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `v0.0.1` in the project description |

## Step 3 — Prepend CHANGELOG entry

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Insert a new `## [NEW_VERSION] - TODAY` section
immediately before the existing `## [OLD_VERSION]` section.

TODAY is the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format (use `date +%F` via Bash).

The entry should document what actually changed since OLD_VERSION. Inspect
`git log OLD_VERSION_TAG..HEAD --oneline` (where OLD_VERSION_TAG is
`vOLD_VERSION`) to find the commits, then write a concise Added/Changed/Fixed
list. If there are no real changes (test release), write a minimal entry such as:

```
## [NEW_VERSION] - TODAY

### Changed

- (describe changes here based on git log)
```

## Step 4 — Run tests

Run the test suite and verify all tests pass:

```
cargo test --release
```

If tests fail, stop and report the failure. Do not proceed.

## Step 5 — Commit

Stage only the files changed in steps 2 and 3 (never `git add -A`):

```
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock CLAUDE.md CHANGELOG.md
```

Commit with message: `Bump version to NEW_VERSION`

Include the standard co-author trailer:
```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Step 6 — Create signed tag

```
git tag -s vNEW_VERSION -m "Release NEW_VERSION"
```

Then verify it:
```
git tag -v vNEW_VERSION
```

Confirm the GPG signature is good before reporting success.

## Step 7 — Report

Tell the user:
- What version was bumped (OLD → NEW)
- That all tests passed
- That the commit and signed tag are ready locally
- That the next step is `/release NEW_VERSION` to push and publish to crates.io
