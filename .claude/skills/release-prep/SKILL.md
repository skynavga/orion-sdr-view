Prepare an orion-sdr-view release for version $ARGUMENTS.

The previous version is the one currently in `Cargo.toml`. Determine it by
reading that file. Call it OLD_VERSION. The new version is $ARGUMENTS;
call it NEW_VERSION.

## Step 1 — Verify preconditions

- Confirm current branch is not `main`. If it is, stop and tell the user.
- Confirm NEW_VERSION > OLD_VERSION (simple string check is fine).
- Check for uncommitted changes (`git status`). If there are uncommitted
  changes, propose a default commit message derived from the branch name and
  staged/unstaged diff summary, then ask the user to confirm or provide an
  alternative message. Commit all staged and unstaged tracked changes using
  that message before proceeding. Do not include a co-author trailer. If the
  user declines to commit, stop and tell them to resolve the working tree first.

## Step 2 — Bump version strings

Update OLD_VERSION → NEW_VERSION in every file listed below. Read each file
before editing it.

| File | What to change |
|------|----------------|
| `Cargo.toml` | `version = "OLD_VERSION"` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `vOLD_VERSION` in the project description |

## Step 3 — Prepend CHANGELOG entry

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Insert a new `## [NEW_VERSION] - TODAY` section
immediately before the existing `## [OLD_VERSION]`

TODAY is the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format (use `date +%F` via Bash).

The entry should document what actually changed since OLD_VERSION. Inspect
`git log OLD_VERSION_TAG..HEAD --oneline` (where OLD_VERSION_TAG is
`vOLD_VERSION`) to find the commits, then write a concise Added/Changed/Fixed
list. If there are no real changes (test release), write a minimal entry such as:

```
## [NEW_VERSION] - TODAY

### Changed

- (describe changes here based on git log)
```

## Step 4 — Run tests

Run the test suite and verify all tests pass:

```
cargo test --release
```

If tests fail, stop and report the failure. Do not proceed.

## Step 5 — Commit

Stage only the files changed in steps 2 and 3 (never `git add -A`):

```
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock CLAUDE.md CHANGELOG.md
```

Commit with message: `Bump version to NEW_VERSION`

Do not include a co-author trailer.

## Step 6 — Merge to main via PR

Push the current branch to origin if it has no upstream yet:

```
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Check whether a PR already exists for the current branch:

```
gh pr list --head CURRENT_BRANCH --state open
```

If no open PR exists, create one. Inspect `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to
understand all changes in the branch, then write a concise BLUF-style summary
(one short paragraph) covering all significant changes. Follow it with a
"Release prep for NEW_VERSION." line. Example format:

```
<One short paragraph summarizing all significant changes in the branch.>

Release prep for NEW_VERSION.
```

Merge the PR:

```
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

Switch to `main` and pull so the local branch is up to date:

```
git checkout main
git pull
```

Confirm the current branch is now `main` before proceeding.

## Step 7 — Create signed tag

```
git tag -s vNEW_VERSION -m "Release NEW_VERSION"
```

Then verify it:
```
git tag -v vNEW_VERSION
```

Confirm the GPG signature is good before reporting success.

## Step 8 — Report

Tell the user:
- What version was bumped (OLD → NEW)
- That all tests passed
- That the commit and signed tag are ready locally
- That the next step is `/release NEW_VERSION` to push and publish to crates.io
